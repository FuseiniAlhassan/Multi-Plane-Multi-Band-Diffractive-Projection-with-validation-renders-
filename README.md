# Multi-Plane-Multi-Band-Diffractive-Projection-with-validation-renders-
This notebook designs a single diffractive phase element that projects different target images at different planes/wavelengths. It now includes validation visualizations: synthetic camera captures near the target planes, RGB composite render, and PSNR/error maps.
